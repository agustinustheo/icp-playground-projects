# Comprehensive Guide to Decentralized Server Development with Azle and User Management on ICP

This comprehensive guide combines insights from two separate projects: "Azle Hello World" and "Azle Cross Canister Calls with SQLite", as well as a "User Management System", to provide a deep dive into building secure, decentralized servers and managing user data on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

## Azle Overview

Azle is a framework designed to aid in the development of secure, decentralized, or replicated servers using TypeScript or JavaScript on the ICP. It is particularly suited for projects aiming to leverage ICP's unique capabilities for building Web3 applications. Azle is currently in beta and supports a wide replication factor, enhancing the security and resilience of deployed applications.

For more in-depth information, refer to [The Azle Book](https://demergent-labs.github.io/azle/).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Linux/WSL: Podman installation is required.
- macOS: Installation of Podman via Homebrew.
- Node.js 20 is recommended for all environments, installed via nvm.

### Detailed Installation Steps

1. **Linux/WSL Installation**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install podman
   ```

2. **Mac Installation**:

   ```bash
   brew install podman
   ```

3. **Node.js and nvm Setup**:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   nvm install 20
   ```

4. **DFX CLI Tools**:

   ```bash
   DFX_VERSION=0.16.1 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
   ```

### User Management System Setup

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the local ICP replica and deploy your canisters using dfx.

## Deployment

### Azle Deployment

1. Create a new Azle project and navigate into the project directory.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the dfx local replica and deploy in a separate terminal.
4. Optionally, enable autoreload for HTTP-based canister development.

### User Management System Deployment

- Deploy the canisters to your local replica or the Internet Computer mainnet as needed.

## User Management System

This system showcases how to manage users in a decentralized database on ICP, featuring a simple web interface for user interaction. It is designed using Rust for both backend and database canisters, ensuring secure and efficient data management.

## Examples

Both projects provide a variety of examples to explore, demonstrating different aspects of application development on ICP, including database management, HTTP request handling, and front-end development.
