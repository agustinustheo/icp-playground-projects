## Introduction to Azle and Rust CDK

Azle is a pioneering framework designed for developers to build decentralized or replicated servers using TypeScript or JavaScript on the ICP, focusing on security and a broad replication factor to leverage ICP's capabilities fully. In parallel, the Rust Canister Development Kit (CDK) enables the creation of high-performance, secure canisters in Rust, suitable for complex data management and processing needs in decentralized environments.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- **Podman** or **Docker** for container management, with specific instructions for Linux/WSL and macOS.
- **Node.js 20**, recommended to be installed via NVM for consistent development environments.
- **DFX CLI Tools**, version 0.16.1, for ICP application management.
- **Rust and Cargo** for compiling Rust canisters, essential for Rust CDK projects.

### Installation Guide

1. Install Podman or Docker as per your operating system requirements.
2. Set up Node.js 20 using NVM to ensure an up-to-date development environment.
3. Install DFX CLI Tools for seamless interaction with the ICP network.
4. Prepare your Rust and Cargo setup for Rust-based canister development.

## Deploying Your First Azle Project

Deploying an Azle project involves initializing the project, installing dependencies, starting the dfx local replica, and deploying your canisters. Optionally, enable autoreload for HTTP-based canister development for an enhanced development experience.

## Understanding User Management with Rust on ICP

Leverage the Rust CDK to develop a User Management System, demonstrating the power of Rust for backend and database canisters, ensuring secure, efficient user data management on ICP. This includes a straightforward web interface for user interactions and database management.

### Setting Up

- Clone your project repository and install Node.js dependencies.
- Utilize dfx to start a local ICP replica and deploy your canisters.
- Engage with features such as adding, viewing, and searching users through the web interface.

## Examples and Tutorials

Explore a plethora of examples and tutorials showcasing application development on ICP, including database management, HTTP request handling, and front-end development across both Azle and Rust CDK. These resources are designed to deepen your understanding and enhance your development capabilities.

## Contributing to the Ecosystem
